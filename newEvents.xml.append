<textList name="TIPS_LIST">
	<text>TIP: Death -   Remember, losing is part of the fun!  ...  No, I'm serious...</text>
	<text>TIP: Grinding Sectors -  It can be beneficial to stay in a Sector for as long as possible to improve the ship since each Sector is increasingly difficult.</text>
	<text>TIP: Exits -  It's tempting to rush for the sector exits, but exploring is the only way to upgrade your ship. Try and get as much out of each sector as possible.</text>
	<text>TIP: Pausing -  Press SPACE at any time to pause the game. You can still issue orders to crew or manipulate system power while paused.</text>
	<text>TIP: Targets -  Prioritize your targeting in combat. Weapons and Shields are usually the best choice, but if they're fleeing, hit their Engines or Piloting to prevent escape.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hidden Choices -  When you see a blue colored choice in an event, it's a special option that has been made available by your current equipment.</text>
	<text>TIP: System Damage -  When a System fully breaks due to fire or boarders, the hull also takes one damage.</text>
	<text>TIP: Selling -  Weapons, drones, and augments can be sold for 1/2 the purchasing price at stores. Click on the SELL tab at the top.</text>
	<text>TIP: Power Bars - Upgraded systems can be helpful even if you don't have enough reactor power to use them; they still absorb one damage.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapons -  You can queue up an attack before the weapon is charged. It will fire when it's charged.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cloaking -  Cloaking prevents enemies from firing on your ship or charging their weapons. It also causes all currently flying shots to miss your ship.</text>
	<text>TIP: Boarding -  If you're having trouble with boarders, fight within the medbay. If all else fails, vent the rest of the oxygen out of the ship!</text>
	<text>TIP: Oxygen -  If the ship's room color changes from tan to red, it means you're losing oxygen. Crew will be damaged and fires will burn out in rooms with an orange border.</text>
	<text>TIP: Shield Piercing -  Missiles ignore shields. Use missiles to damage a powerful ship's Shield System. Just remember that Defense Drones can shoot down missiles!</text>
	<text>TIP: Choices -  Results of most choices have multiple outcomes. You can never be sure what will happen.</text>
	<text>TIP: Autofire -  Autofire will let a weapon maintain its target. Just keep an eye on your missile count!</text>
	<text>TIP: Evasion -  Evading enemy shots is crucial but it requires functioning engines AND a pilot. Having someone man the engines will increase your evasion as well.</text>
	<text>TIP: Sensors -  If the ship goes dark, don't panic. Just fix the Sensors Subsystem.</text>
	<text>TIP: Drones -  If you're struggling against enemy Drones, target the Drone System to temporarily disable them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Beams -  Beam weapons do damage based on the number of rooms they hit.  Each Shield bubble will block 1 damage of a beam; it's best to use beams when their shields are down.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fire -  If fire is spreading, consider opening airlocks and doors to vent the oxygen from parts of your ship. Fire is quickly extinguished without O2.</text>
	<text>TIP: Health -  Pay attention to your crew's health! Use the medbay to keep them patched up.</text>
	<text>TIP: Upgrades -  Don't forget to upgrade your ship! Often shields are the highest priority, but don't underestimate the usefulness of subsystems.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fuel -  Every jump consumes one unit of fuel, so keep an eye on your reserves. Buy fuel at stores to avoid being left stranded.</text>
	<text>TIP: Sound -  Go into the options menu to turn on or off the sound effects and music.</text>
	<text>TIP: Asteroids -  Fighting in asteroid fields is dangerous, but use it to your advantage. Take out enemy shields and let the rocks take care of the rest.</text>
	<text>TIP: Nebulae -  Passing through a Nebula will allow you to temporarily slow down the fleet advancement but they contain their own unique dangers.</text>
	<text>TIP: Solar Flares - Solar flares will cause hull damage in addition to starting fires. Make sure your shields are up to help mitigate this effect.</text>
	<text>TIP: Score - Your score is based on how many ships you defeat, the number of beacons explored, and your total scrap collection.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hotkeys -  You can charge or arm weapons using number hotkeys:  The Weapon Slots are 1-4 on your keyboard, and the Drones are 5-7 (customizable in the options).</text>
	<text>TIP: Augmentations -  Your ship can only hold 3 augmentations. They provide unique benefits to a system, the crew or the entire ship.</text>
	<text>TIP: Breaches -  If a room with a breach has no Oxygen, try opening all the doors surrounding it to make it less hazardous.</text>
	<text>TIP: Font Size - Pressing +/- (customizable in options) will let you change the event text size.</text>
	<text>TIP: Rebel fleet - The rebel fleet (represented by the red circle on the map) moves closer to your position every time you jump. Certain events can slow or speed up their movement speed.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapon Order - Rearrange a weapon or drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The left-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ion Weapons - Ion weapons de-power and lock a System for a time. If they hit the enemy shields they deal their stun damage directly to the Shields System.</text>
	<text>TIP: Bomb Weapons - Bombs teleport directly onto either ship. They bypass Shields AND Defense Drones. However they affect crew and Systems; they do no damage to the ships hull.</text>
	<text>TIP: Door Subsystem - Upgrading your doors once will greatly reduce the chance fire will spread between rooms. Upgrading them again will cause doors to significantly slow boarder movement.</text>
	<text>TIP: Armed Space Stations - Enemy space stations have strong hulls but usually no engines. That means they can not move and therefore are unable to dodge. Use this to your advantage.</text>
	<text>TIP: Light Lasers - These lasers are good for killing crew, but can not deplete shields or damage systems and ship hull. Use them to empty ships of personnel or to support your boarders and keep an eye on your crews health when you are taking fire from light lasers.</text>
	<text>TIP: Auto Lasers - These lasers seem weak on their own, but can make formidable support weapons if you can deplete the enemy shields with other guns.</text>
	<text>TIP: Burst Missile Launchers - Some missile launchers fire multiple weak projectiles. These weapons are perfect to take out critical systems on fast moving, well shielded enemies.</text>
	<text>TIP: Effectors - These electronic-warfare devices surpass shields, allowing you to shut down enemy systems at will. Use them to target key systems.</text>
	<text>TIP: Artillery Class Weapons - Some weapons have devastating firepower, but cool down slowly and cannot deplete shields effectively. They work great against enemies with low evasion, but might need support weapons to deplete enemy shields.</text>
	<text>TIP: Focused Beams - Some beam weapons deal high damage, but can an only hit one room. Use them to get through enemy shields or to damage fast moving opponents.</text>
	<text>TIP: Alternative Targets - Keep in mind that Weapons and Shields are not always the prime targets. Some enemies might rely on different systems for attacking or defending themselves. Target them accordingly.</text>
	<text>TIP: Scouts - These ships only have weak hulls, but can bring a lot of firepower to the fight.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fighters, Bombers and Assault Classes - These ships are well rounded and have no special strengths and weaknesses. Like all enemies, their equipment and weapon load-out depends on the faction they belong to.</text>
	<text>TIP: Troopships - These ships are almost always equipped with teleporters and transport a lot of personnel. Get your crew ready for close combat when you encounter them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Interceptors - These fast ships can dodge a lot of your attacks. Target their helm or engines first to slow them down. Burst weapons and powerful beams can make short work of them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Medevacs - These medical support ships are always equipped with proper medbays and usually transport extra crew, which makes boarding them quite difficult.</text>
	<text>TIP: Repair Ships - These slow and fragile support ships are always equipped with various repair drones, which makes damaging them quite difficult. They might even repair hull damage throughout the fight.</text>
	<text>TIP: Drone Carriers - These slow ships will use attack drones as their primary mean of attacking, but can't power a lot of conventional weaponry.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hunter Classes - Some enemy ships are specialized for injuring and killing your crew and might even use weaponry designed for that purpose. Keep an eye on your crew's health and make good use of your medbay when encountering them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Exotic Ships - Some enemy ships are specialized in unique ways and might be equipped with distinct armaments or equipment. Try to discover their capabilities and weaknesses to deal with them effectively. You can always flee from an encounter if you are not sure what you are dealing with.</text>
	<text>TIP: Anti-Hull Weapons - Some weapons and drones deal extra damage when fired at empty rooms. While they perform poorly against small ships, they can come in handy against enemies with a lot of hullpoints and empty rooms, like space stations and cruisers.</text>
	<text>TIP: Capital Ships - Your cruiser is not designed to fight every type of ship. If you feel that your enemy outright outclasses you, then trying to flee might be your best bet.</text>
	<text>TIP: Rebel Cruisers - When the fleet catches up with you, you might have to fight strong Rebel elite cruisers and the Rebels will also station these ships at exit beacons.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fighting Rebel Cruisers - Taking out Rebel cruisers can throw the fleet into disarray and buy you some time, but fleeing from these powerful ships might often be the better option.</text>
	<text>TIP: Tech Missile Launchers - Some missile weapons can scramble enemy defense systems and will only be shot down by level 2 defense drones.</text>
	<text>TIP: Trade Routes - Trading is most lucrative between sectors of different types (civilian, hostile, hazard). Check the sector map and plan your route through the sectors accordingly to increase your profits.</text>
	<text>TIP: Trade Goods Level - Trade goods come at different scarcities (basic, common, uncommon, rare, legendary). This puts them into different price ranges. Buying more expansive goods requires greater investments, but also nets bigger profits with one haul.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cargo Space - Trade goods take up Augmentation slots. Make sure you have enough cargo space when buying commodities. If you realize that your holds are already full then you can still sell the goods back to the shop with minimal scrap loss.</text>
	<text>TIP: Selling Goods - Trade goods sell prices are negotiable, resulting in slightly random profit from each haul. Sell prices are more likely to sway in your favor when selling goods with higher rarity levels.</text>
	<text>TIP: Supply and Demand - Trade goods can not be event-sold in sectors where they are for sale. You can still quick-sell the commodities at the shop to free up cargo space, but delivering them to other sectors and then selling them in trade events makes better money.</text>
	<text>TIP: Trading Time - Negotiating prices and transferring cargo usually takes a lot of time. If you engage in trade at shops the Rebel fleet will catch up with you faster.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cargo Teleporters - Stores sometimes have cargo teleporters, allowing you to sell and buy goods without loosing time. Stores in trade-affine sector types (most civilian) are more likely to have cargo teleporters.</text>
	<text>TIP: Sector Trade Capacity - Some sectors are more suitable for trading then others. Far out places and regions with disrupted economy have less to offer. Stable core regions, on the other hand, sell and buy a lot of goods at good prices.</text>
	<text>TIP: High Demand - There is always a region of space where even the most ordinary of goods are in high demand. If you know where your freight is really needed you can make very high profits with a single haul.</text>
	<text>TIP: Quick Selling - You can always sell your trade goods directly to the shop, but only at bad prices. This way you can quickly get rid of excess cargo.</text>
	<text>TIP: Piracy - Resorting to piracy will disillusion your crew and might make them desert your cause, but can also net you additional scrap and trade goods.</text>
	<text>TIP: Pirate Factions - Some aliens are known to prey on defenseless ships on a regular basis. The crew of these factions' ships will not revolt if you engage in piracy.</text>
	<text>TIP: Slow Reloading Defense Drone - Some defense drones reload slow and cannot take a shot at every incoming missile, they will however take out the fist missile fired at you, doing that at minimal power requirements. They are also ineffective when defending against asteroids.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fast Reloading Defense Drone - More advanced defense drones fire very fast and should be able to take down multiple incoming projectiles at once.</text>
	<text>TIP: Light Drones - These drones are designed to injure enemy crew, but cannot damage the enemy ship's hull. They are especially useful to soften up resistance before your boarders move in.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ion Drones - These drones are mainly useful for ionizing enemy shields, as you can not control where they aim.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ship Size - The amount of rooms an enemy ship has factors into how effective certain drones are against them. Most drones excel when attacking smaller ships, because they are more likely to hit crew and systems.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cargo Ships and Freighters - These ships often carry valuable cargo. They possess little firepower and rely on powerful engines and jump drives to avoid confrontations.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hazard Sectors - The Rebel fleet will struggle to pursue you through these sectors full of ion storms and asteroid fields. Exploring them isn't always advisable. Hazard Sectors have little infrastructure and are full of dangers.</text>
	<text>TIP: Civilian Coreworlds - These peaceful sectors offer a lot of opportunities to work and trade, but be careful, losing the Rebel fleet will be harder in populated areas and you never know who might give your position away to them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Federation Controlled Sectors - Federation controlled sectors will be under Rebel attack when you arrive. There will be fierce fighting almost everywhere.</text>
	<text>TIP: UI Prompts - Some weapons leave no visible traces, but your ship's computer will inform you about their activity with small UI prompts. The computer will also warn you about dangerous weapons fired at you via these prompts.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapon Spread - Certain weapons, like swarm missile launchers and heavy scatter lasers, spread their projectiles over a wide area. This way they deal good damage to the ship's hull, but less damage to crew and systems inside the ship.</text>
	<text>TIP: Mines - Space mines explode in close proximity to ships, dealing maximum damage to the hull. They cannot damage systems or crew and travel quite slow. Use them to finish off weakened enemies.</text>
	<!-- <text>TIP: Encased Systems - Some enemy ships have certain systems deeply encased within their ship. The icon for these systems are displayed on the borders between rooms. Encased systems can't be damaged by any weapon or drones.</text> -->
	<text>TIP: Combat Augments - Combat augments can disrupt your opponent's systems during battle. Without special equipment your ship can only power one of these augments at the same time.</text>
	<text>TIP: Production Augments - Some augments can help you to conserve or gather resources. You need to find a beacon where you are undisturbed in order to use them.</text>
	<text>TIP: AI Crew - Holographic crew members are not as tough as organic or partly organic beings, but they can get any job done and don't require oxygen.</text>
	<text>TIP: Debris Fields - The destruction of bigger ships might create vast debris fields. You can choose to spend more time in order to salvage additional materials, but the Rebel fleet will catch up faster if you do so.</text>
	<text>TIP: Minefields - Fights in Minefields will cause proximity mines to home in on your ship early in the fight. Jump away before they hit you, or use drones or engine power to counter them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Planetary Defense Weapons - Advancing into hostile territory might confront you with heavy planetary defense weapons. These guns charge slow; it is best to jump away before they fire.</text>
	<text>TIP: Planetary Artillery - This defense weapon charges slow but pierces all shields and can cause fires and breaches. UI prompts will inform you about its targeting cycle and can tell you which rooms it will hit.</text>
	<text>TIP: Planetary Beams - This defense weapon charges slow but will shoot right through your shields and ship, causing breaches. UI prompts will inform you about its targeting cycle and can tell you which rooms it will hit.</text>
	<text>TIP: Rebel Point Defense System - If the fleet catches up with you the Rebels might consider finishing you off with a long range artillery barrage. Their PDS weapons charge faster than planetary defenses, try to get away in time.</text>
	<text>TIP: Utility Bombs - Some bombs are designed to be beamed into your own ship, but they can still miss. If you want to make sure that they hit you will have to de-power your engines before firing them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Sector Names - Sector names contain key words that give away which faction controls them. In time you will get a feel for what sector type to expect.</text>
	<text>TIP: Industrial Sectors - These nebula type sectors feature large, hazard rich dust clouds that might often best be avoided, unless you want to risk salvaging the derelict equipment that can often be found within them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Quarantine Sectors - Some civilian sectors are under lockdown after dangerous diseases have spread. The plague might take its toll on your crew but many people also will want to leave the system and might join you.</text>
	<text>TIP: AI Controlled Sectors - These sectors are taken over by rogue combat AIs. The all-consuming nano-bot clouds that these AIs command are one of the most hazardous places in the galaxy.</text>
	<text>TIP: Crew Interaction - An old Federation proverb says: "If you get to a place with nothing else to do, you can always just chat with your crew."</text>
	<text>TIP: Crew Morale - Maintaining a good relationship with your crew is good for morale. And conversing regularly with your crew might open you all kinds of possibilities.</text>
	<text>TIP: Crew Background - Most of your crewmen will have been around in the galaxy for some time. Conversing with certain crew in certain sectors might result in interesting reveals.</text>
	<text>TIP: Acid Clouds - These industrial hazards will damage your ship while charging your FTL drive. Time consuming activities like salvaging and the usage of certain augments will result in more damage.</text>
	<text>TIP: Pollution - These industrial smog clouds will affect your ship's sensors and clog the engines. Pollution hazards can vary in density, more dense clouds will have stronger effects on engines and sensors.</text>
	<text>TIP: Nano-Bot Clouds - Nanite swarms are capable of disassembling your hull and can disrupt all systems. This nebula hazard usually won't affect the enemy ships and should best be avoided entirely.</text>
	<text>TIP: Black Holes - Jumping near a black hole is actually much less dangerous than it sounds. However, you will need to spend more fuel to escape its gravitational pull.</text>
	<text>TIP: Anomalies - These rare, unexplainable hazards will jam your sensors, drone communication and weapon targeting.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ion Barriers - This curious space phenomena create massive barriers that emit strong ion fields. Your shields will be weakened near them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Missile Drone Defense - Be aware that your own defense drones can also intercept the slow missiles fired by anti-ship missile drones.</text>
	<text>TIP: Mine Defense - Defense drones can easily pick off space mines that approach your ship. This is of course especially usefully if you happen to jump into a minefield.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cloaked Projectiles - Some weapons fire cloaked missiles or drop stealth mines. These projectiles can only be intercepted by level 2 defense drones.</text>
	<text>TIP: Enemy Combat Augments - Enemy combat augments work just like the ones deployed by you. Discovering the effects and limitations of different combat augments can teach you how to defend yourself against them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ice Fields - Ice fields exist in remote areas far away from active stars. These areas have almost no background radiation to speak of, which makes cloaking devices useless and hiding impossible within them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Zoltan Diplomacy - Commanding a ship of the wise Zoltan will give you a natural degree of authority. You will be able to negotiate favorable surrender offers and find peaceful resolutions for many conflicts.</text>
	<text>TIP: Slug "Flexibility" - The Federation is well known to use Slug auxiliaries for their dirty work. Your crew will not expect you to stick to the rules if you command a Slug vessel.</text>
	<text>TIP: Player Surrender - Remember that you often can try to surrender if you are actively attacked. This might cost you some resources, but can save you life in certain situations.</text>
	<text>TIP: Breaking Ceasefire Agreements - Attacking an opponent whose surrender offer has been accepted constitutes an intergalactic war crime. This might disturb your crew a bit.</text>
	<text>TIP: Making Surrender Offers - Bigger compensation offers will increase the chance of your surrender being accepted. Most opponents will always accept a good enough offer.</text>
	<text>TIP: Trustworthiness of Opponents - Not all your opponents will obey to the general etiquette of space combat. Certain factions might attack you again after you transfered a surrender offer.</text>
	<text>TIP: Outposts - These military stations are well armed. Prepare for a tough fight when happening upon one.</text>
	<text>TIP: Checkpoints - Checkpoint stations are often attacked and are therefore equipped with clone bays to protect their staff. They can have various other systems as well.</text>

	<text>TIP: Nano-Bot Clouds - Nanite swarms are capable of disassembling your hull and can disrupt all systems. This nebula hazard usually won't affect the enemy ships and should best be avoided entirely.</text>
	<text>TIP: Black Holes - Jumping near a black hole is actually much less dangerous than it sounds. However, you will need to spend more fuel to escape its gravitational pull.</text>
	<text>TIP: Anomalies - These rare, unexplainable hazards will jam your sensors, drone communication and weapon targeting.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ion Barriers - This curious space phenomena create massive barriers that emit strong ion fields. Your shields will be weakened near them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Missile Drone Defense - Be aware that your own defense drones can also intercept the slow missiles fired by anti-ship missile drones.</text>
	<text>TIP: Mine Defense - Defense drones can easily pick off space mines that approach your ship. This is of course especially usefully if you happen to jump into a minefield.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cloaked Projectiles - Some weapons fire cloaked missiles or drop stealth mines. These projectiles can only be intercepted by level 2 defense drones.</text>
	<text>TIP: Enemy Combat Augments - Enemy combat augments work just like the ones deployed by you. Discovering the effects and limitations of different combat augments can teach you how to defend yourself against them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ice Fields - Ice fields exist in remote areas far away from active stars. These areas have almost no background radiation to speak of, which makes cloaking devices useless and hiding impossible within them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Zoltan Diplomacy - Commanding a ship of the wise Zoltan will give you a natural degree of authority. You will be able to negotiate favorable surrender offers and find peaceful resolutions for many conflicts.</text>
	<text>TIP: Slug "Flexibility" - The Federation is well know to use Slug auxiliaries for their dirty work. Your crew will not expect you to stick to the rules if you command a Slug vessel.</text>
	<text>TIP: Player Surrender - Remember that you often can try to surrender if you are actively attacked. This might cost you some resources, but can save you life in certain situations.</text>
	<text>TIP: Breaking Ceasefire Agreements - Attacking an opponent whose surrender offer has been accepted constitutes a galactic war crime. This might disturb your crew a bit.</text>
	<text>TIP: Making Surrender Offers - Bigger compensation offers will increase the chance of your surrender being accepted. Most opponents will always accept a great offer.</text>
	<text>TIP: Trustworthiness of Opponents - Not all your opponents will obey to the general etiquette of space combat. Certain factions might attack you again after you transfered a surrender offer.</text>
	<text>TIP: Outposts - This military stations are well armed. Prepare for a tough fight when happening upon one.</text>
	<text>TIP: Checkpoints - Checkpoint stations are often attacked and are therefore equipped with clone bays to protect their staff. They can have various other systems as well.</text>
	<text>TIP: EW Platforms - Electronic Warfare stations are always equipped with hacking systems. Be prepared to deal with system disruption when engaging them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hives and Broodstations - Some factions heavily rely on cloning facilities to swell their ranks. When you find yourself near one of their cloning stations you will have to deal with almost endless waves of boarders.</text>
	<text>TIP: Surveyors and Instigators - Some ship classes rely on mind control systems to force your crew to sabotage your ship. You will have to somehow deal with your turned crewmen if you encounter them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Trade Advantage - Trading might seem like a waste of time at first, but keep in mind that buying and selling is much less risky than roaming around the sector.</text>
	<text>TIP: Artillery System - The expensive artillery system you can buy at stores will equip your ship with its signature artillery weapon, often providing a strong boost for your offense.</text>
	<text>TIP: Faction Artillery - Buy the artillery system to discover the various artillery guns available. Certain ships might receive different kinds of artillery.</text>
	<text>TIP: Artillery Offense - Some ships have access to devastating artillery, but depend on normal weapons to weaken enemy defenses.</text>
	<text>TIP: Non-Lethal Artillery - Some artillery weapons deal no damage, but never the less provide great advantages in combat. For example by ionizing enemy ships or incapacitating crew.</text>
	<text>TIP: Combat Events - A lot of things can happen in ship-to-ship combat. Don't let your guard down.</text>
	<text>TIP: Combat Augment Power Cost - The energy cost of combat augments can be offset with the internal generator augment. You can engineer it at empty beacons if you have combat augments.</text>
	<text>TIP: Auto Sectors - This sectors are under the control of automated construction ships. You will rarely encounter manned ships here.</text>
	<text>TIP: Pirate Homeworlds - Strong pirate cruisers roam the pirate strongholds. Better come prepared.</text>
	<text>TIP: Rock Sectors - Extremely tough stations and many missile wielding enemies can be encountered in this sectors. The Black Hole hazard is also common here.</text>
	<text>TIP: Mantis Sectors - The Mantis will often try to overwhelm you with boarders. Their brood stations and convoys can teleport almost infinite amounts of warriors to your ship.</text>
